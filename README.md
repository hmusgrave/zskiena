a walk through the algorithm design manual in zig

## Purpose

This is just a brain-dump of me working through a textbook.

## IP

The code is AGPL. A copy of the book is present since I'm a bit forgetful and it ensures I'll have all the resources I need as I come back to the repo over time, but you shouldn't use it unless you also own a copy.
