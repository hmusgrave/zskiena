  log(sqrt(n))
= log(n**(1/2))
= (1/2) log n

The two bounds are both O(n log n).

If such a queue existed, you could insert an array full of data into it in O(n), then extract the data back out in sorted order in O(n) via the O(1) Extract-Max operation. This contradicts the Î©(n log n) bound for general sorts.
