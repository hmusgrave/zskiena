Let u and v be vertices on opposite sides of the bridge (elements of the connected components left behind when the bridge is removed). Note that every path from u to v must contain the bridge e (or else on removal of just e, u and v would still be connected by that path and hence not from distinct connected components). Since DFS iteratively builds a tree connecting every node, the DFS tree does have a path from u to v. All such paths contain e.
